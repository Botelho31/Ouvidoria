# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Go to develop branch, to run latest code:

### `git checkout develop`

Now that you opened the source code, on the latest version, is necessary to setup the environment.
And the following link shows how to do that: [Setup Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

Now that every thing is setup, is necessary to run the application, whether on a mobile device whether on a emulator.

First you have to open a terminal, and start Metro (Metro is a bundler, that runs in the middle of the device and the code itself).

### `npx react-native start`

After that is necessary to run the application, and for that, you have to chose if you want to run on android

### `npm run android`

Or you want to run on a IOS device

### `npm run ios`

Now that everything is running, you just have to create your account or log with your own account.
